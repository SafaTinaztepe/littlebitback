  <h2>We want to get people talking about the bitcoin economy.</h2>
  <p>Little Bit Back is the effort of several strangers who met via Reddit to create a hub for all of the interesting things going on in the crypto-economy. If the blockchain is the evidence of Bitcoinâ€™s past, we want Little Bit Back to be the history book, or at least the newspaper.
  By placing a spotlight on and providing context to the motion of money around the internet, we feel we can draw greater attention to the power of crypto-currencies.</p>
  <p>Let's engage people in the movement of <i>their</i> money.</p>
